There comes a point in every project where you stop philosophising over a glass of ouzo and start dealing with reality.
These pedals already exist.
The circuits are designed. The components are selected. The enclosures, knobs, and artwork are finished. What you’re seeing isn’t a concept or a rendering—it’s working hardware.

![Oepicus Guitar Pedals on the carpet](/assets/posts/pedals_in_line.jpeg#w-30%;a-left)Right now, these pedals are being tested the way they’re meant to be tested: in real homes, on real floors, under real feet. They’re being played, pushed, and occasionally abused. This phase isn’t about invention anymore; it’s about refinement. Small, careful adjustments. Listening closely. Making improvements right up until we lock things down and commit to production.

Yes, some of this is happening on carpets.
Very ordinary carpets.
The kind you’d expect in apartments where people actually live and make music.
At the same time, elsewhere at Oepicus, the work continues at a different scale. Prototypes are being refined. Circuit boards are laid out and produced. Pick-and-place machines do their precise, unglamorous dance—far less sci-fi than they sound, and far more reliable.
Jokes aside, this is what we do. And we’re good at it.

And if that still wasn’t enough reassurance, we’re already manufacturing enclosures—real aluminium, real processes, real output. Not someday. Not hypothetically. Now.
Making things is what we do every day. It’s how we think, how we work, and how we measure progress. That’s why you can have confidence that you’re backing people who understand not just ideas, but execution.

![Oepicus Guitar Pedals on the carpet](/assets/posts/colourful_enclosures.jpeg#w-30%;a-right)We’re moving these pedals from the subconscious to the conscious.
From ideas to objects.
From carpeted apartments to factory benches.
And soon, onto your pedalboards.
